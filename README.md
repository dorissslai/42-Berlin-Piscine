# 42-Berlin-Piscine

## About 42 School
42 School is a non-profit coding school that offers software development training completely tuition-free. It aims to  empower the next generation of coders through a more accessible and inclusive approach to tech education.

First founded in Paris in 2013, 42 Schools educate their students to the equivalent of a master's degree and rely on peer learning methods that give each individual autonomy.

## About Piscine
The Piscine is the last phase before full admission to the 42 School.  This intensive four-week program is used by various 42 campuses worldwide as both a selection process and a condensed introduction to their peer-to-peer learning methodology. It's designed to not just test participants' coding abilities, but also their adaptability in a collaborative environment. 

## My Piscine Reflection
I completed my Piscine at 42 Berlin from February-March 2025 and was successfully accepted into the school. 

During the 4 weeks, I completed:
- 2 Shell projects, 
- 7 C projects
- 2 Rush projects
- 3/4 exams

My Piscine experience was both challenging and rewarding. It was my first experience with the C programming language and while I struggled at times, I also learnt a lot along the way. 

I genuinely enjoyed 42’s peer to peer learning methodology. It pushed me out of my comfort zone, helping me to build communication and collaborative skills. Furthermore, it has allowed me to connect with and learn from many amazing people.

Beyond the curriculum, the 42 Berlin campus is amazing as well. The campus is beautiful, well equipped with facilities, dog-friendly and supported by a fantastic team of staff members.

For me, the Piscine wasn't just a coding bootcamp. It was also about becoming part of an inspiring and supportive community. I’m excited to continue my journey with 42 Berlin and see where it can take me!

## Skills Developed
### Technical skills
**C programming**

**Shell**

**Git**

### Soft skills
**Collaboration**
Every weekend, there will be “Rush”, a 48 hours group project. It requires working closely in teams, encouraging effective collaboration under time pressure.

**Communication**
With 42’s emphasis on peer to peer learning, communication is essential. Each individual project whereby participants are required to explain their code clearly before passing. Group projects like the Rush also further reinforce the need for clear, respectful, and efficient communication

**Time Management**
The piscine does not have a fixed  deadlines or timetable. This means that participants must be accountable for their own progress and manage their time efficiently.

**Proactiveness**
Without teachers, learning at 42 requires a high level of initiative. Participants must actively seek out information, solve problems independently and help each other grow. This develops a strong sense of self-motivation, curiosity, and resourcefulness.
